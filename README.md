Implemented by Abhineet Jain (https://github.com/AbhineetJain) and Chandan Kharbanda

The main idea behind Imagine is to enable students to gain hands-on experience to use LOGO (Language Oriented Graphic Oriented), and Paint (similar to MS-Paint) applications.

The project implements the two applications using Canvas and uses JavaScript extensively.

This web application, based in web2py, allows its users to create and save artworks using both these applications. 
The User Interface, and User Experience is intuitive, and flows easily.
